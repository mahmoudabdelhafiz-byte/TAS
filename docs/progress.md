## Done

### 1. Product definition (2026-10-13)
| | Item |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Scope for container + multipurpose terminals: TOS validation before booking, capacity slots, dual transactions, gate matching, multipurpose cargo mode |
| ✅ | Capacity model agreed: default capacity per hour per category → seasonal templates → exceptional overrides for specific hours/days |
| ✅ | Competitor review (Conroo): adopted driver-side features — simple multilingual app, traffic light, digital gate pass, geofence ETA, yard guidance, trucking company API |
| ✅ | Differentiators: lower cost, Arabic-first, FASAH/Mawani fit, multipurpose cargo |

### 2. Design & database (2026-10-13)
| | Item | Where |
|---|---|---|
| ✅ | Data model (33 tables) incl. driver app, geofencing, yard guidance, messaging | `docs/data-model.md` |
| ✅ | Database choice: PostgreSQL + PostGIS (SQL Server still possible for on-premise via EF Core) | `docs/data-model.md` |
| ✅ | Schema, validated on PostgreSQL 16 | `db/schema.sql` |

### 3. Capacity engine (2026-10-14) — commit `02a914f`
| | Item |
|---|---|
| ✅ | .NET 10 solution: Domain, Application, Infrastructure (EF Core + Npgsql), API |
| ✅ | Slot planning: default + seasonal templates, overrides (set/adjust/close), overbooking, quotas per category |
| ✅ | Availability: category quota vs slot total, quota release to pool, reservations (priority customers / walk-ins) |
| ✅ | Slot generation that keeps bookings and flags over-capacity instead of cancelling; background worker every 6 h |
| ✅ | Race-safe booking counters (10 concurrent bookings for 2 places → exactly 2 succeed) |
| ✅ | API: generate slots, availability per day/category, health |
| ✅ | GitHub Actions CI with PostgreSQL + PostGIS; test counts published per run |

### 4. Booking flow (2026-10-14) — commit `41e4e82`
| | Item |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Book a truck visit with 1–4 moves (dual transactions, twin 20') |
| ✅ | Multipurpose cargo booked by BL / cargo reference, trips drawn down from the release |
| ✅ | Checks before booking: ISO 6346 check digit, container not in two live appointments, company/truck/driver ownership, per-truck daily limit |
| ✅ | TOS adapter interface + configurable fake N4 (availability, customs/line/terminal holds, payment, booking, VGM, cut-off, cargo release) |
| ✅ | Failed check → booking rejected with reasons; warning → booked with amber light |
| ✅ | Cancel (cut-off 60 min before slot; terminal staff any time), reschedule (until gate-in), assign truck/driver |
| ✅ | Driver traffic light (red / amber / green / grey with reason) |
| ✅ | Automatic no-shows: capacity released, company no-show count increased; worker every 10 min |
| ✅ | Demo terminal seeder + demo containers for each scenario (Development only) |
| ✅ | Tests: 50 unit + 16 database integration, all passing in CI |

### 5. Authentication & roles (2026-10-14)
| | Item |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Login with email + password (PBKDF2 hashing), 30-min access tokens, 14-day refresh tokens |
| ✅ | Refresh tokens rotate on each use; re-using an old one signs the user out everywhere |
| ✅ | Lockout after 5 wrong passwords (15 min); login rate limit per IP; unknown emails indistinguishable from wrong passwords |
| ✅ | Logout; password change ends all other sessions; password policy |
| ✅ | Roles: CompanyAdmin, CompanyUser, Planner, GateClerk, TerminalAdmin, SysAdmin |
| ✅ | Company isolation: company users only see / book / change their own company's appointments |
| ✅ | Terminal scope: staff only at their own terminal; book on behalf of companies; planners/admins regenerate slots |
| ✅ | User creation within the admin's scope; first SysAdmin created from configuration |
| ✅ | API takes the user from the token (`userId` removed from request bodies) |
| ✅ | Database: auth columns, refresh token table, upgrade script `db/migrations/002_auth.sql` |
| ✅ | Tests: 79 unit + 16 database + 9 end-to-end API, all passing in CI |

### 6. Capacity admin API (2026-10-14)
| | Item |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Weekly default template and seasonal templates: create, edit (whole grid), remove seasonal |
| ✅ | Validation: overlapping windows, times (24:00 = midnight), quotas, capacity and overbooking limits, dates |
| ✅ | Overrides set / adjust / close for specific hours with a mandatory reason; lift an override |
| ✅ | Reservations for priority companies / walk-ins; quota release rules; terminal settings |
| ✅ | Slot board: capacity vs booked per slot and category, closed and over-capacity flags |
| ✅ | Audit log of every change: who, when, why, before / after values |
| ✅ | Affected slots regenerate immediately; bookings are kept and over-capacity is flagged |
| ✅ | Access: terminal staff view; planners and terminal admins change; companies have no access |
| ✅ | Tests: 94 unit + 16 database + 16 end-to-end API, all passing in CI |

### 7. Master data API (2026-10-14)
| | Item |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Companies: list / search, register, edit, activate / suspend with reason (suspended companies cannot book) |
| ✅ | Trucks: one plate form for Arabic and Latin input (Saudi letters mapped, Arabic-Indic digits), unique across companies |
| ✅ | Drivers: ID / Iqama, mobile normalized to +966…, preferred language |
| ✅ | Blocking trucks / drivers is a terminal decision (TerminalAdmin), with reason; blocked trucks can't be booked |
| ✅ | Transaction categories per terminal; new or re-activated categories are bookable at once (slots regenerate) |
| ✅ | Cargo releases (BL / DO) with trips / tonnage; trips can't drop below what's booked; companies see only their own |
| ✅ | Users: list within scope, edit, change role, deactivate (reason), reactivate, admin password reset |
| ✅ | Security: every request re-checks the account — deactivation and role changes take effect immediately |
| ✅ | All changes audited |
| ✅ | Tests: 121 unit + 16 database + 21 end-to-end API, all passing in CI |

### 8. Bulk booking (2026-10-14)
| | Item |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Upload `.xlsx` or `.csv` (comma / semicolon / tab, UTF-8, BOM); columns by name or alias in any order |
| ✅ | Dates and times as text, real Excel date/time cells, or raw Excel numbers |
| ✅ | Rows sharing a `visit` become one appointment (dual transactions, up to 4 moves) |
| ✅ | File checks: required columns, dates / times, one date-time-truck-driver per visit, container not twice in the file, 500-row limit |
| ✅ | Dry run (default): every booking check incl. TOS, plus capacity counted across earlier rows of the file; nothing booked |
| ✅ | Real run: visit-by-visit booking, partial success, per-row results with appointment numbers and reasons |
| ✅ | Trucks by plate (Arabic or Latin) and drivers by ID / Iqama, resolved for the company |
| ✅ | Downloadable Excel template (with instructions sheet) and CSV template |
| ✅ | Booking service split into prepare / commit so previews run exactly the same checks as bookings |
| ✅ | Tests: 129 unit + 16 database + 26 end-to-end API, all passing in CI |

### 9. Re-checks before arrival (2026-10-14)
| | Item |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Scheduled re-checks of appointments starting within 24 h (at most every 60 min each); an unreachable TOS leaves them due for the next run |
| ✅ | On-demand re-check by the company or terminal staff |
| ✅ | Start trip: re-checks right before the truck leaves, refuses while anything is red (hold, unpaid, window passed), marks EN_ROUTE; at most 12 h before the slot |
| ✅ | Item statuses, stored traffic light and last-checked time updated; changes written to the appointment history |
| ✅ | Notification outbox: STATUS_RED / STATUS_CLEARED queued for the driver (SMS, driver's language) and the booker (email) |
| ✅ | Booking and re-checks share one set of item checks (check digit + TOS) |
| ✅ | Database: `appointment.last_validated_at`, upgrade script `db/migrations/003_revalidation.sql` |
| ✅ | Tests: 129 unit + 20 database + 27 end-to-end API, all passing in CI |

### 10. Gate (2026-10-14)
| | Item |
|---|---|
| ✅ | Generic lane API for Autogate / OCR / clerk screens: plate, container, QR and appointment-number reads |
| ✅ | Matching: QR / number first, then plate (Arabic or Latin) nearest to now, then container; warnings for reads that don't fit |
| ✅ | Re-check against the TOS at the gate; admit or refer (early, late, not cleared, blocked, already in, cancelled, no appointment) |
| ✅ | Trouble desk: admit with note, reject with note (capacity released), walk-in booking into the current slot using the walk-in reserve, dismiss |
| ✅ | Statuses ARRIVED → GATE_IN → COMPLETED / REJECTED_AT_GATE; check-in method recorded (OCR, QR, clerk) |
| ✅ | Gate event log; turn time (arrival → exit) and time inside (gate-in → exit) |
| ✅ | Gate board: trucks at the gate and inside with minutes, open troubles, completed today, average turn time |
| ✅ | Lanes per terminal (demo: IN-1, IN-2, OUT-1) |
| ✅ | Database: `gate_trouble`, upgrade script `db/migrations/004_gate.sql` |
| ✅ | Tests: 139 unit + 26 database + 28 end-to-end API, all passing in CI |

## Open decisions
| ❓ | Question | Affects |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Make the GitHub repository private? (currently public) | Code confidentiality |
| 2 | Customer hosting: cloud service from us, or on-premise at the terminal? | Database, deployment, pricing |
| 3 | N4 integration path: web services, EDI, or database views? | Phase C |
| 4 | Is a national appointment platform mandatory at the customer's port? | Phase C |
| 5 | Driver identity: mobile OTP enough, or Nafath / liveness required for ISPS? | Phase E |
| 6 | Gate check-in: QR scan at lane, or geofence + OCR plate match only? | Phases B, E |
| 7 | Fees: free booking, paid booking, or penalties for no-show / late only? | Phase A, billing |
| 8 | Slot length: fixed per terminal, or different lengths by time of day? | Capacity engine |
| 9 | Can N4 provide yard positions per truck visit in real time? | Yard guidance |
